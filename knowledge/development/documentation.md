# Documentation

Covers: Chapter 13 - Documentation (man pages and vignettes).

## Man pages (Rd files)
- Every exported function and class must have a man page.
- Class documentation must be very detailed about the structure and type of
  information stored in the object.
- Data man pages must include provenance information and data structure
  information.
- A package-level man page is encouraged, accessible via `?<package name>`.
- Documentation may be authored with roxygen2 (comments compiled to Rd) or written
  directly as Rd.

## Examples (runnable)
- All man pages should have runnable examples.
- `\donttest` and `\dontrun` are generally not allowed except with proper
  justification.
- If wrapping is unavoidable, prefer `\donttest` over `\dontrun`.

## Vignettes
- At least one vignette is required, in Rmd (recommended), qmd (Quarto), or Rnw
  (Sweave) format.
- Code must be executable and demonstrate actual functionality: "Non-trivial
  executable code is a must!!! Static vignettes are not acceptable."
- Each vignette should include an Introduction, Installation instructions, a Table
  of Contents (when appropriate), and a `sessionInfo()` call.
- Installation instruction chunks must use `eval = FALSE`.
- R Markdown vignettes should use the BiocStyle package for rendering.
- Quarto vignettes require the Quarto command-line tool to be listed in
  DESCRIPTION.

## Overall documentation standards
- Vignettes demonstrating core functionality.
- Man pages for all exported functions, each with runnable examples.
- Well-documented data structures and datasets.
- References to the methods used and to related packages.
