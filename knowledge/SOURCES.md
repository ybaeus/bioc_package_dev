# Sources and refresh baseline

This file records where each summary came from and the exact upstream state it was generated
against. Use it to detect drift and to refresh only what changed. `docs/REFRESH.md` is the
procedure; this file is the data. `scripts/verify.py --network` reads both.

## Tracked upstreams (update every pin on every refresh)

Five upstreams, not one. A change to any of them can silently invalidate the guidance here.

| Upstream | Pin | Verified | Invalidates |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Bioconductor/pkgrevdocs](https://github.com/Bioconductor/pkgrevdocs) (`devel`) | `9b078ea2a0ec05274be83cb12ea75473c6d0c808` (committed 2026-07-20) | 2026-08-14 | all of `knowledge/` |
| [Bioconductor/Contributions](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions) `issue_template.md` | `d2631e3da63092937a96d476c6f7fb915a168069` (committed 2021-07-12) | 2026-08-14 | the pre-submission gate wording in `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`, `agents/bioc-package-review.md` |
| [Bioconductor/BiocCheck](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocCheck) | release 1.48.1, devel 1.49.30 | 2026-08-14 | what "BiocCheck clean" means; what the review agent should pre-empt |
| [lcolladotor/biocthis](https://github.com/lcolladotor/biocthis) | release 1.22.0, devel 1.23.0 | 2026-08-14 | the scaffolding block in the three router files, and `scripts/golden-path.R` |
| [grimbough/bioc-actions](https://github.com/grimbough/bioc-actions) | `v1.0.16` (`455bb7a12b1f0df041fc1078de581d2c508839d9`) | 2026-08-14 | `.github/workflows/verify.yml` |

Bioconductor cycle at the last refresh: release 3.23, devel 3.24, both on R 4.6.0
(source: https://bioconductor.org/config.yaml).

Other baseline facts:

- Rendered guide: https://contributions.bioconductor.org
- Summaries fetched: 2026-08-14 (files edited on that date carry that `Fetched` stamp; files
  untouched since the previous pass still carry 2026-07-23 and are still accurate, because the
  pkgrevdocs pin has not moved between the two dates)

Machine-readable endpoints used for drift detection:

- pkgrevdocs commit: `https://api.github.com/repos/Bioconductor/pkgrevdocs/commits/devel`, field `sha`
- changed files since the pin: `https://github.com/Bioconductor/pkgrevdocs/compare/<pinned>...devel`
- chapter order: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bioconductor/pkgrevdocs/devel/_bookdown.yml`
- BiocCheck / biocthis versions: `https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/VIEWS` and
  `.../devel/bioc/VIEWS` (parse `Package:` / `Version:` pairs - the HTML landing pages are not
  reliably parseable)
- bioc-actions tags: `https://api.github.com/repos/grimbough/bioc-actions/tags`

## Chapter map: .Rmd source -> rendered slug -> knowledge file

Two columns are needed, not one. The GitHub compare API reports changed **`.Rmd` filenames**,
while every `Source:` footer in `knowledge/` cites a **rendered slug** - and they routinely differ
(`package-maintainence.Rmd` renders to `package-maintenance.html`, note the upstream misspelling;
`bioc-classes-methods.Rmd` renders to `reusebioc.html`). A drift report can only be scoped to the
right files by joining through this table.

Rendered pages live at `https://contributions.bioconductor.org/<slug>.html`. Chapter order and
`.Rmd` names come from `_bookdown.yml`; slugs come from each chapter's `{#id}` anchor.

Three slugs are deliberately marked "not summarized": `index`, `develop-overview` and
`package-maintenance` are welcome or part-overview pages whose entire body is a sentence or two of
orientation. They carry no rules to summarize. They are listed anyway so the chapter-coverage
check in `verify.py --network` can tell "we decided not to summarize this" apart from "we missed
a chapter".

## Not chapter-derived (maintain by hand)

`index.md` (router), `workflow.md` (runbook), and this file.
